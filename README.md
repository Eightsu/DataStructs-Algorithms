# DataStructs-Algorithms
DS and Algos to study and learn from

## Getting Started

Peruse the files, each file deals wth it's own data structure or algorithm. I'll be adding more detailed comments through the code as time goes on. I'm hoping this could be used to give folks a quick leg up on any of the material.

### Prerequisites
* None, just read it if you'd like
* clone the repo if that's your fancy to play with locally
